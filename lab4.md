Keys pressed: `<up><enter>` The `ssh bkhor@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in the search history, so I used the up arrow to access it. 

## Step 5

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl+R> git c <enter>` The `git clone git@github.com:brandonkhor/lab7.git` command was the command that show up when I pressed <Ctrl+R> and typed `git c`, autofilling to `git clone git@github.com:brandonkhor/lab7.git`.

## Step 6

Keys pressed: `<Ctrl+R> c <enter>`, `<Ctrl+R> b <enter>` I first changed the directory to lab7 using the command `cd lab7`, which I accessed using <Ctrl+R> and typed `c`, autofilling to `cd lab7`. Then I used `bash test.sh` to run the test cases, accessing it the same way as the previous one, but typing `b` instead to autofill to `bash test.sh`.
